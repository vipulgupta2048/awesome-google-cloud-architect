[Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) is a managed compute platform that enables you to run stateless containers that are invocable via HTTP requests. Cloud Run is serverless: it abstracts away all infrastructure management, so you can focus on what matters most — building great applications.

[Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) is built from [Knative](https://cloud.google.com/knative/), letting you choose to run your containers either fully managed with Cloud Run, or in your [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes) cluster with Cloud Run on GKE.
